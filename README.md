# File-handling-alternative-without-streams-
This programme allows us to handle the files by creating , opening and closing them without using the concept of sreams . I discovered this method
It basically creates a file in which records can be added and through a graphical user interface after which the data received will be 
organised and stored in a particular format . You can add your own directory where I have mentioned .
